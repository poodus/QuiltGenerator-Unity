# QuiltGenerator-Unity
Unity app for generating quilt designs based on device camera colors.

The app shows you the device camera view with a "flying geese" quilt pattern overlaid (made with a procedural mesh). When you active a triangle from the pattern, you can recolor the block by clicking on an area of the camera image. You can toggle between quilt and block views to refine your work.
